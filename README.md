# Customer-Segmentation
Given a large dataset of customer transactions, we aim to perform customer segmentation to understand buying behaviors. By using the K-Means clustering algorithm, we will group customers based on their purchasing patterns. This segmentation will help identify key customer groups, allowing the company to tailor marketing strategies and improve sales performance. The project will involve preparing the data, applying the K-Means algorithm, and analyzing the resulting clusters to provide actionable insights for more effective and targeted marketing. Additionally, we'll ensure the solution is scalable, cost-effective, and leverages relevant customer features for accurate segmentation.
